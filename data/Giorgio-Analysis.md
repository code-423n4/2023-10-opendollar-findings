The audited part of the open dollar protocol is in essence owned by the governance. Which makes it fairly centralized. The governance has the ability to change key contracts that control the collateral. 


I would have loved to see more natspec describing functions. Also the natspec structure is not respected, 
although not conform to the norm I wasn't really surprised to see view functions before external functions but it's not common practice to place a constructor after couple of external functions. It would be best practice to follow the common pattern structure, the codebase would gain in clarity, readability an order.


I personally wasn't able to run the tests, as the NFT part requires special setup that I couldn't access. However, I recommend adding more tests and exploring various 'unhappy paths.'
