## Phase 1: Documentation and Video Review

A: Start with a comprehensive review of all documentation related to the Open Dollar platform, including the whitepaper, API documentation, developer guides, user guides, and any other available resources.

B: Watch any available walkthrough videos to gain a holistic understanding of the system. Pay close attention to any details about the platformâ€™s architecture, operation, and possible edge cases.

C: Note down any potential areas of concern or unclear aspects for further investigation.

## Phase 2: Manual Code Inspection

I: Once familiarized with the operation of the platform, start the process of manual code inspection.

III: Look for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, improper error handling, etc., while also ensuring the code conforms to best programming practices.

IV: Document any concerns or potential issues identified during this stage.

## Phase 3: Architecture recommendations:  
   
   1. ODGovernor:
   The codebase follows a modular and composability approach, integrating various OpenZeppelin governance contracts and using inheritance to combine their functionalities.
   It inherits from several parent contracts, which are widely recognized and well-audited in the Ethereum community, making the codebase more reliable. 

   2. Vault721:
   The code is designed to restrict the owner to the Vault721 contract. This is an appropriate and secure approach if the intention is to prevent ownership  changes and maintain control within a specific contract.

   3. SAFEHandler 
   The code implements a straightforward approach where a new SAFEHandler contract is deployed for each safe. This allows for a unique identifier for each safe. It's a minimalistic and efficient approach for its intended purpose.

   4. ODSafeManager:
   The architecture is designed to manage SAFEs and their permissions within the Open Dollar protocol.
   The contract efficiently manages SAFEs by utilizing an auto-incremental _safeId to uniquely identify each SAFE.
   It uses separate mappings for different types of permissions to ensure precise control over who can perform what actions.

## Phase 4: Codebase quality analysis:

   1. AccountingEngine
   The code uses various libraries for common functions, which is a good practice to keep the code modular and maintainable.
   It implements authorization, allowing specific accounts to perform certain actions.
   It provides a way to set parameters and initialize the contract with specific settings.
   The contract has functions for debt queue management, debt settlement, surplus auctions, and more, which are well-organized.

   2. CamelotRelayer:
   The code appears well-structured and organized.
   It clearly defines the base and quote tokens, the Camelot pair, and other necessary parameters.
   The use of libraries like OracleLibrary for price calculations is a good practice as it keeps the code modular and reduces complexity.
   The code parses the result into an 18-decimal format for standardization.
   Error handling is in place to handle situations where the pool doesn't have sufficient history.
   The code is relatively concise and easy to follow.

   4. UniV3Relayer: 
   The code is well-structured and organized.
   It clearly defines the base and quote tokens, the Uniswap V3 pool, and other necessary parameters.
   The use of libraries like OracleLibrary for price calculations is a good practice as it keeps the code modular and reduces complexity.
   Error handling is in place to handle situations where the pool doesn't have sufficient history.

   5. ODGovernor:
   It specifies the token (ODG - Open Dollar Governance token) and the timelock controller as constructor parameters.
   The use of well-established contracts, such as TimelockController, Governor, and others, demonstrates a high level of code quality and security.
   The code includes required override functions to customize parameters based on the needs of the OD protocol.

   6. ODProxy:
   The code is simple and focused on its primary purpose: allowing the owner (defined in the constructor) to execute arbitrary calls on a target address.
   It uses error handling through custom error messages, which is a good practice for providing clear information about why a transaction might revert.
   The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the pre-defined owner can call the execute function.

   7. Vault721:
   The code uses modifiers for access control (e.g., onlyGovernor, nonZero) to ensure proper permissions and input validation.
   The initializeManager and initializeRenderer functions help set the initial instances of safeManager and nftRenderer contract addresses.
   Events are emitted to provide transparency regarding proxy creation and other important contract actions.
   Functions like mint, updateNftRenderer, and updateContractURI have restricted access through the onlyGovernor modifier.

   8. SAFEHandler:
   It correctly interacts with the ISAFEEngine contract by calling the approveSAFEModification function to grant the msg.sender (most likely the ODSafeManager) permission to modify the safe.
   There are no redundant or unnecessary operations, and it effectively achieves its goal.

   9. ODSafeManager:
   The usage of libraries, such as Math and EnumerableSet, is a good practice for code reuse and gas efficiency.
   The contract interacts correctly with the SAFEEngine and Vault721 contracts.
   Proper error handling is implemented through the use of custom error types.
   The use of modifiers (safeAllowed and handlerAllowed) enforces access control.
   Events are emitted to provide transparency and enable external systems to track changes.

## Phase 5: Centralization risks:

    1. CamelotRelayer:
    The code relies on the Camelot pool for price data. The centralization risks might come from the Camelot pool itself, and it's essential to evaluate the reliability and decentralization of the pool and its data sources.

    2. UniV3Relayer:
    The code relies on the Uniswap V3 pool for price data. The centralization risks might come from the Uniswap V3 pool itself, and it's essential to evaluate the reliability and decentralization of the pool and its data sources.

    3. ODGovernor:
    Centralization risks for this code are likely tied to the ownership and control of the governance token and the timelock controller. Careful consideration should be given to who has control over these entities.

    4. ODProxy:
    The centralization risk in this contract is by design: it enforces that only the specified owner can perform actions. This is a specific security measure and might be suitable for certain use cases, like managing a critical operation within the Vault721 contract. However, it's important to be aware of the limitations and implications of centralization in a broader context.

    5. Vault721:
    The contract assigns a governor address, and most critical functions are restricted to this governor. This introduces centralization risk if the governor's private key is compromised or if there is a lack of transparency regarding the governor's identity.
    Centralization risk is also introduced by design when the contract deploys and manages proxies.

    6. ODSafeManager:
    The centralization risks are relatively low within this contract. It is primarily designed to interact with other contracts, and its permissions are well-defined.
    The ownership of the SAFEs is transferred via the Vault721 contract. Therefore, the centralization risk might be more related to how Vault721 is governed.

## Phase 6 Mechanism Review:   
    
    1. AccountingEngine:
    The code implements functions for managing debt queues, settling debt, and conducting surplus auctions.
    The contract seems to handle these mechanisms reasonably well, but the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on the overall design and functionality of the entire system.

    2. CamelotRelayer:
    The code effectively fetches the price from the Camelot pool and provides methods to get the result with validity.
    It uses the time-weighted average price (TWAP) for better accuracy.

    3. ODGovernor:
    The contract allows for proposing and executing changes to the protocol. Proposals can be created with specific targets, values, and calldata, and the proposal must pass a voting process based on the set parameters (voting delay, voting period, quorum, etc.).
    The use of a timelock period between proposal success and execution adds an additional layer of security to prevent rushed decisions.

    4.SAFEHandler:
    The core mechanism is straightforward. Upon deployment, this contract grants specific permissions to the ODSafeManager. The specific mechanism used (approveSAFEModification) depends on the implementation of the ISAFEEngine contract.\

    5. ODSafeManager:
    The core mechanism of this contract is to manage SAFEs and their permissions efficiently.
    It allows users to open SAFEs, transfer ownership, modify collateralization, transfer collateral and internal coins, and more. These functions are necessary for a SAFE management system.


## Phase 7: Systemic Risks: 

   Systemic risks are typically associated with governance. If the governance process is centralized or controlled by a small group, it can lead to vulnerabilities and systemic risks for the entire protocol. It is essential to ensure a decentralized and well-distributed governance process.
