`mint()` in `vault721` isn't checking if the `safeId` already exist before minting, it is recommended to include a check for duplicate `safeId` even if there's a nonce increment it adds additional safe guard.

Permission Level Validation Issue in `SafeCan` Mapping

The mapping is designed to store the  `_ok`  value, which represents permission levels (0 for not allowed and 1 for allowed).

•The `allowSAFE()` does not check if the user had been added to the `safeCan` mapping. It is advised to include a check if the `_usr` being added already exist in the mapping so that a `_usr` won't be added twice causing issues when trying to change `_ok` to 0.

•Also there's no explicit validation or checks in the `allowSAFE` function, allowing the possibility of assigning values outside the valid range (0 or 1). This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
Assigning a value of 2 or other invalid values to  `_ok` without proper handling or validation could lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially compromising the security and functionality of the system.

##FIX 
Include proper checks and validation in the relevant function to enforce the valid range of the  `_ok`  parameter (0 or 1). Reject any values outside this range to ensure consistent and expected behavior. Also check if the user had already been added.

The functions `transferCollateral` and `transferInternalCoins` aren't checking if `_dst` address is valid not a dead address. Including this check will prevent collateral and coins  not to be lost forever.

Users can choose to call `quitSystem` if they want to remove a safe from the system, this will send the `safeData` to a specified `_dst` account by calling `ISAFEEngine` 

```  ISAFEEngine(safeEngine).transferSAFECollateralAndDebt(
      _sData.collateralType, _sData.safeHandler, _dst, _deltaCollateral, _deltaDebt
    );
```
However there's no check if the `_dst` is a null or zero address transfering the `safeData` to a zero address leading to loss of safe.

The `moveSAFE` function is used to move the safe from `_safeSrc` to `_safeDst`  the function checks if the `_src` and `_dst` collateral types match but doesn't check if the `_safeDst` mapping exist. This check should be included so users won't move safe to a non existent safe destination.

`addSAFE` function is called when new safes are being added to the system by a user, the function adds a new safe to the user safes mapping. 

There's no check indicating if the `_safeId` exist in the mapping before adding it, this can lead to addition of the same `_safe` which might cause issues when trying to access the safe due to mapping ordering. Include a check if the safe had been added before adding the new one.
